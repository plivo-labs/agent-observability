# agent-observability-sdk

The Python SDK for shipping evals + telemetry to
[agent-observability](https://github.com/plivo-labs/agent-observability).
Three surfaces in one install:

- **LiveKit helpers** — bootstrap the tag bundle the v2 server expects
  (`init_observability`), run judges against a session report
  (`run_judges_on_report`), resolve the upload URL
  (`ensure_observability_url`). For workers that drive LiveKit Agents
  directly; agent-transport's `AudioStreamServer` does this internally.
- **Judges** — nine LiveKit-compatible judges ported from
  [cx-sqs-worker](https://github.com/plivo/cx-sqs-worker) (Hallucination,
  Response Accuracy, Tool Correctness, Loop Detection, …) plus a
  `default_judges()` composition helper. Plug straight into
  `livekit.agents.evals.JudgeGroup` alongside LiveKit's built-ins.
- **pytest plugin** — auto-registered via `pytest11` entry-point.
  Every `pytest` run becomes one `eval_run` in the dashboard; every
  test function becomes an `eval_case` with events, judgments, and
  failure detail. Same plumbing the deprecated standalone
  `pytest-agent-observability` package used to ship.

## Install

```bash
pip install agent-observability-sdk
```

`livekit-agents>=1.5.2,<1.6`, `pytest>=7.0`, and `httpx>=0.24` are hard
deps and installed automatically. Python ≥ 3.10.

## Quick start

### 1. Raw LiveKit worker (text or audio, your own `AgentServer`)

```python
from agent_observability.livekit import init_observability, run_judges_on_report
from livekit.agents import AgentServer, JobContext
from livekit.agents.evals import accuracy_judge, safety_judge

server = AgentServer()

async def on_session_end(ctx: JobContext) -> None:
    report = ctx.make_session_report()
    await run_judges_on_report(
        report,
        judges=[accuracy_judge(), safety_judge()],
    )

@server.rtc_session(agent_name="support-bot", on_session_end=on_session_end)
async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext) -> None:
    init_observability(
        ctx.tagger,
        agent_id="9c2f7e3d-…",       # stable opaque UUID
        agent_name="support-bot",
        account_id="acct-7",
        transport="text",
    )
    # …your usual AgentSession.start(...) setup
```

That's the whole observability surface for a raw-LiveKit worker. No
hand-rolled `tagger.add(...)` calls, no `JudgeGroup` boilerplate, no
`llm.aclose()` cleanup.

### 2. agent-transport worker (`AudioStreamServer`)

Don't use the helpers — agent-transport already emits tags and runs
judges via its own `EvaluationConfig`. You only consume the **judges**
catalogue from this package:

```python
from agent_observability.livekit.judges import (
    default_judges,
    IntentAccuracyJudge,
    rigid_response_accuracy_judge,
)
from agent_transport import AudioStreamServer
from agent_transport.evaluation import EvaluationConfig
from livekit.agents.evals import accuracy_judge

ctx.evaluation = EvaluationConfig(
    judge_llm=judge_llm,
    judges=[
        accuracy_judge(),
        IntentAccuracyJudge(expected_intent="book_flight", actual_intent=...),
        rigid_response_accuracy_judge(expected_response="...", llm=judge_llm),
        *default_judges(llm=judge_llm),
    ],
)
```

### 3. pytest suite

The plugin is auto-discovered — install the SDK, point at the dashboard,
done. Tests with `AgentSession.run(...)` and `.judge(...)` work as-is.

```bash
export AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_URL=https://obs.example.com
export AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_AGENT_ID=9c2f7e3d-4b8a-4d2e-9f1b-…
pytest
```

```python
# In a test file
import pytest
from livekit.agents import AgentSession, inference

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_greeting():
    async with inference.LLM(model="openai/gpt-4.1-mini") as llm, \
               AgentSession(llm=llm) as sess:
        await sess.start(Assistant())
        result = await sess.run(user_input="Hello")
        result.expect.next_event().is_message(role="assistant")
        await result.expect.next_event(type="message").judge(
            llm, intent="greets politely",
        )
```

**Auto-capture is on by default.** Every `RunResult` from
`AgentSession.run(...)` is collected automatically and `.judge(...)`
calls are intercepted as first-class Judgment events in the dashboard.
The `capture(result)` helper is exported for RunResults produced
outside the standard `.run()` path:

```python
from agent_observability.livekit.pytest import capture
```

## Configuration

| Env var | CLI flag | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LIVEKIT_OBSERVABILITY_URL` | — | Dashboard base URL (LiveKit-canonical name). Required by `init_observability` (raises if unset). |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_URL` | `--agent-observability-url` | Same purpose; `init_observability` accepts this as a fallback and mirrors it into `LIVEKIT_OBSERVABILITY_URL` so LiveKit's upload code picks it up. |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_AGENT_ID` | `--agent-observability-agent-id` | Stable opaque agent identifier. Strongly recommended — without it the session lands unparented on the dashboard (the server accepts the upload but has nothing to backfill the FK with). UUIDs preferred over slugs. |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_ACCOUNT_ID` | `--agent-observability-account-id` | Multi-tenant account id. Optional. |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_USER` / `_PASS` | — | Basic-auth credentials when the server enables auth. Optional. |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_TIMEOUT` | `--agent-observability-timeout` | Upload request timeout in seconds (default `10`). |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_MAX_RETRIES` | `--agent-observability-max-retries` | Max upload attempts before falling back (default `3`). |
| `AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_FALLBACK_DIR` | `--agent-observability-fallback-dir` | Directory for failed-upload JSON (defaults to `.pytest_cache/agent-observability`). |

CI metadata (GitHub / GitLab / CircleCI / Buildkite) is auto-detected
by the pytest plugin from standard env vars — no configuration needed.

## Judge reference

### LLM-based (7 factories)

Each returns a LiveKit `_LLMJudge` you pass straight to a `JudgeGroup`:

- `hallucination_judge(llm=...)` — fabricated info?
- `rigid_response_accuracy_judge(*, expected_response, llm=...)` — semantic match against an expected text.
- `freeflow_response_accuracy_judge(llm=...)` — contextually appropriate in an open-ended conversation?
- `hold_requested_intent_accuracy_judge(llm=...)` — was a "hold" / "wait" reply justified?
- `variable_extraction_judge(*, expected_variables, actual_variables, llm=...)` — were the right values extracted, grounded in the transcript?
- `loop_detection_judge(llm=...)` — agent repeating itself?
- `knowledge_base_correctness_judge(*, kb_context, llm=...)` — KB lookup faithfully reflected?

### Programmatic (2 classes, no LLM call)

- `IntentAccuracyJudge(*, expected_intent, actual_intent)` — case-insensitive string match.
- `ToolCorrectnessJudge(*, expected_tools, threshold=1.0)` — auto-extracts function-call events from `chat_ctx`; set-membership scoring.

### Composition helper

- `default_judges(llm=None) -> list[Judge]` — the four ground-truth-free
  judges (Hallucination, Freeflow Response Accuracy, Hold-Requested
  Intent Accuracy, Loop Detection). Spread next to your own
  ground-truth-bound judges.

### Which judges need what data?

| Judge | Required at construction | Read from `chat_ctx` |
|---|---|---|
| `hallucination_judge` | — | full conversation |
| `rigid_response_accuracy_judge` | `expected_response` | latest assistant message |
| `freeflow_response_accuracy_judge` | — | full conversation |
| `hold_requested_intent_accuracy_judge` | — | latest assistant message + prior user turn |
| `variable_extraction_judge` | `expected_variables`, `actual_variables` | full conversation (for grounding) |
| `loop_detection_judge` | — | latest assistant message + prior 2-3 |
| `knowledge_base_correctness_judge` | `kb_context` | full conversation |
| `IntentAccuracyJudge` | `expected_intent`, `actual_intent` | — (ignored) |
| `ToolCorrectnessJudge` | `expected_tools` | `function_call` items (auto-extracted) |

## Migrating from `pytest-agent-observability`

The standalone `pytest-agent-observability` package is **discontinued**.
The last published release (0.2.1) still installs and runs, but
predates this SDK's helpers and judges. Migrate by switching the
dependency + import:

```diff
-pytest-agent-observability
+agent-observability-sdk
```

```diff
-from pytest_agent_observability import capture
+from agent_observability.livekit.pytest import capture
```

The plugin is auto-discovered via `pytest11` entry-point — no extra
config needed. Auto-capture, `.judge()` interception, retry / fallback
behaviour, and CI metadata extraction are byte-for-byte identical.

## Not ported from cx-sqs-worker

Two judges are intentionally absent because their prompts are tightly
coupled to the cx-sqs-worker flow-graph runtime (global vs. node
instructions, closed available-intents list):

- `semi_rigid_response_accuracy`
- `intent_detection`

Use `rigid_response_accuracy_judge` or `freeflow_response_accuracy_judge`
for response evaluation; use `IntentAccuracyJudge` for closed-set
intent checks.
